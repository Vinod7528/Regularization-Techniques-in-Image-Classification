//Installation Instructions

- Use Google Colab for the lab (recommended, as it provides free GPU).
- In Colab, set the runtime to use a free T4 GPU.
- Download the dataset using the provided link in the notebook.
- Unzip/extract the dataset files.
- All necessary Python packages are pre-installed in Colab.

//Documentation

- The lab is about classifying images of dogs and cats using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- The dataset is split into training and validation sets.
- Images are organized into separate folders for dogs and cats.
- Data generators are used to load and preprocess the images.
- A basic CNN model is built for binary classification.
- The model is trained for 10 epochs.
- Training and validation accuracy and loss are tracked during training.
- Results are visualized using accuracy and loss plots.

//Usage Guidelines (Simple Points)

- Follow the notebook cells in order from top to bottom.
- Make sure the dataset is fully downloaded and extracted before proceeding.
- Check that the data directories are correctly organized (dogs and cats in separate folders for both training and validation).
- Observe the training progress and validation results after each epoch.
- Use the provided plots to evaluate model performance.
- If you want to improve results, you can experiment with regularization or data augmentation as suggested in the lab.
